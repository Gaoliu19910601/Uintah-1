# Sample .scirunrc file.
#
# This file comes from the SCIRun src tree:
#   ./SCIRun/src/scirunrc
#
# All variables in this file have been commented out or set
# to their default values.  The first portion of this file
# includes a list of environment variables that can be either
# set in your shell or here.  If you set these variables in 
# your shell, they will override the values in this file.
#
# The second section includes GUI preferences that may only
# be set in this file.
#
# Lines the begin with '#' are commented out.  Environment
# type variables must use the syntax:
#
#    Enviro_Var_Name = Value
#
# GUI preferences use this syntax:
#    GuiSetting <true,1,on,yes|false,0,off,no>

#### ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SECTION ##############################################
#
# REMEMBER, if these variables are set in your shell environment, they will
# override the valuse in this file.

# Flips the XY values of the render window. (Not 100% sure on this one...)
#
# FLIP_CAM_MANIP = false

# The following environment variables can be set in order to help
# monitor and control the allocation of memory.  The environment
# variables are ONLY USED if DISABLE_SCI_MALLOC was NOT defined when
# SCIRun was configured.  If DISABLE_SCI_MALLOC is defined, then
# SCIRun will use the built in new, free, alloc, etc and will ignore
# these variables:
#
# MALLOC_STRICT: Places markers in unused memory and uses them to
#  verify memory integrity.  Unless you wish to check memory integrity
#  explicitly using the "audit()" function, MALLOC_LAZY should NOT be
#  set.
#
# MALLOC_STRICT = false
#
# MALLOC_LAZY: By default, memory is audited for problems on each
#  allocation and deallocation.  If MALLOC_LAZY is set, then auditing
#  is turned off.  This can speed up code that allocates and
#  deallocates memory frequently.
#
# MALLOC_LAZY = false
#
# MALLOC_TRACE [filename]: If MALLOC_TRACE is set, then every memory
#  allocation, reallocation, and deallocation will be logged.  If
#  "filename" is not provided, this information will be printed to
#  "stderr".
#
# MALLOC_TRACE = trace.out
#
# MALLOC_STATS [filename]: If MALLOC_STATS is set, when SCIRun exits,
#  it will output a list of statistics regarding memory usage during
#  the run.  This includes the number of alloc/free calls, the amount
#  of fragmentation, the amount of memory that is free and that is in
#  use, etc.  If "filename" is not provided, then "stderr" is used.
#
# MALLOC_stats = stats.out

#
# The following variables should not be necessary in most situations.
#
# Path to use in searching for package libraries.
# SCIRUN_PACKAGE_LIB_PATH = /path/to/package/libs
#
# 
# SCIRUN_PACKAGE_SRC_PATH = /path/to/package/src
#
# The format of SCIRUN_LOAD_PACKAGE is a comma seperated list of
# package names.  This list specifies the package libraries to load
# when SCIRun is first brought up.
#
# SCIRUN_LOAD_PACKAGE = BioPSE,Uintah,Teem

# SCI_NOSPLASH = false

# On SGIs, override the system setting for number of processors on
# machine.

# SCI_NPROCESSORS = 1

# Set if regression testing is being done.  Will cause SCIRun to exit
# after producing an image.

# SCI_REGRESSION_TESTING = false

# Action to take when a signal interrupts scirun.
#
# SCI_SIGNALMODE = ask

# Turns off the SCI Trivial Allocator

#### GUI PREFERENCES SECTION ####################################################
#
# GUI Preferences are detailed in: ./SCIRun/src/Dataflow/GUI/GuiPreferences.tcl

### Allows the user to tell a module to fetch the GUI from wherever it
#   happens to be on the screen and bring it to the mouse, and then
#   return it to its previous location.

UseGuiFetch on

### Makes GUIs appear near the mouse on GUI creation.
