-   Verification of each function.


-   Note that currently gravity is turned off in this version of ICE.  Gravity
    is turned on in NIST Fire

-   Add u_eject to the thermal elements. 


-   In the function compute_initial_constants_NIST_TE the following variables
    have been hardwired in cp_inf, T_inf, A_fire, and rho_inf.
    
 -   Add some mechanism so that only the TEs inside of the domain are "active" (long Term)


-   There is some checkerboarding in the pressure field that needs to be checked out

-   Dump thermal element's data to tecplot files

-   Add movie making capabilities to plot_particles function
