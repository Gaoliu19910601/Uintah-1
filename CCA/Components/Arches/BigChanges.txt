The pressure solver has been segregated so the major sections of the solve are
now individual tasks.  The tasks are: 

  sched_buildLinearMatrix 
  sched_setRHS_X_wrap
  sched_SolveSystem
  schedExtract_X
  sched_normalizePress
  sched_addHydrostaticTermtoPressure
  
In the previous implementation these sections were place inside of a loop
over patches.  This change should not change any of the answers.

To reverse this change execute:

svn merge -r47642:47641 https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/uintah/trunk/src/CCA/Components/Arches
