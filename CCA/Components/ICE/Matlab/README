Description of current directories:
ICETodd - Todd's original (~2004) matlab simulation of ICE for
          the one-dimensional shocktube problem,
          mid-2004.
ShockTube1D - Oren's modified 1D shock tube simulation of ICE,
          building on Todd's code and adding some printouts, bug
          corrections, etc,
          October 2004 - May 2005.
PressureSolve - pressure solver & discretization for AMR-ICE-implicit.
          Matlab simulations of different discretization schemes
          (DFM, modified Ewing-Lazarov-Vasilevski), accuracy studies,
          June 2005.
SolverBug - matlab scripts and data files comparing the Uintah and
          Hypre matrices in implicit ICE (one level, not AMR),
          July 2005.
