This documentation describes how to checkout an initial copy
of the SCI project source tree.

1) Make sure that you are in the group "sci".  Type "groups", and
   you should be in the list of groups that are shown.

2) Type "which merge".  This should say /usr/sbin/merge (on SGI),
   and NOT /usr/local/bin/merge or /usr/local/gnu/bin/merge.  If the
   wrong version of merge is shown, then change your PATH so that
   /usr/sbin appears before the offending version.

3) Append the following 4 lines to your .cshrc file:
if ( -f /home/sci/data1/development/scripts/develop.csh ) then
   setenv SCI_WORK ~/work
   source /home/sci/data1/development/scripts/develop.csh
endif

   and then source your .cshrc file

4) Choose a suitable space for your work directory to be located.
   It is best to have the work directory on a disk which is local
   to the machine from which you usually compile.  Compiles take
   2-3 times as long over the network.
   Your home directory is a bad choice, because the tree can be
   large and will cramp your quota.  The home directories also reside
   on heavily loaded file servers and will slow down compilation.

   If you don't already have a subdirectory on the selected disk,
   make one.  /home/sci/data2/sparker where I put mine.

5) cd to this directory, and type "cvs checkout work"
   This will copy the master source tree to a subdirectory called
   work.

6) Change to your home directory, and make a symbolic link to this
   new work directory.  For example:

   ln -s /home/sci/data2/sparker/work work

   Type "cd ~/work" to make sure that this works.

7) Copy a variant.h file from the development directory that will
   define the build which you are going to use.  For the SGI, do:
   cp $SCI_DEVELOP/variant_sgi.h variant.h
   (do this from the work directory).

8) type "xmkmf" to build the initial Makefile

9) type "make World" and wait for it to build.  (About 45 minutes
   as of 10/4/94).
