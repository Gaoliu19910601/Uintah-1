Assert.h is a simple utility for providing code invariants
(assertions).  There are three forms:

ASSERT(condition)
Generates an AssertionFailed exception if condition is false.

ASSERTEQ(c1, c2)
Generates an AssertionEQFailed exception if c1 != c2.  c1 and c2
should be castable to int.   The advantage of using this instead of
using ASSERT(c1 != c2) is that the value of c1 and c2 are printed with
the abort message.

ASSERTRANGE(exp, lower, upper)
Equivalant to ASSERT(exp >= lower && exp < upper).  This is also
able to print the values of all of the invloved expressions upon
failure.

For more information about exceptions, see Exception.txt.  They
usually cause a core dump.

Assertions are only compiled if the flag SCI_ASSERTIONS is set at
compile time.
