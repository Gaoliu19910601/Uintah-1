This documentation describes how to checkout an initial copy
of the SCI project source tree.

1) Make sure that you are in the group "sci".  Type "groups", and
   you should be in the list of groups that are shown.

2) Type "which merge".  This should say /usr/sbin/merge (on SGI),
   and NOT /usr/local/bin/merge or /usr/local/gnu/bin/merge.  If the
   wrong version of merge is shown, then change your PATH so that
   /usr/sbin appears before the offending version.

3) Append the following 4 lines to your .cshrc file:
if ( -f /home/sci/data1/development/scripts/develop.csh ) then
   setenv SCI_WORK ~/SCIRun
   source /home/sci/data1/development/scripts/develop.csh
endif

   and then source your .cshrc file in each window which you will be
   working.  Alternatively, you can log out and log back in.

If you are using the Korn Shell, try this:
if [ -r /home/sci/data1/development/scripts/develop.ksh ]
 then
    SCI_WORK=~/SCIRun
    export SCI_WORK
    . /home/sci/data1/development/scripts/develop.ksh
fi

4) Choose a suitable space for your work directory to be located.
   It is best to have the work directory on a disk which is local
   to the machine from which you usually compile.  Compiles take
   2-3 times as long over the network.
   Your home directory is a bad choice, because the tree can be
   large and will cramp your quota.  The home directories also reside
   on heavily loaded file servers and will slow down compilation.

   If you don't already have a subdirectory on the selected disk,
   make one.  For example, I made a directory called
   /home/sci/data6/sparker where I put my work directory

5) cd to this directory, and type "cvs checkout SCIRun"
   This will copy the master source tree to a subdirectory called
   work.

6) Change to your home directory, and make a symbolic link to this
   new work directory.  For example:

   ln -s /home/sci/data6/sparker/SCIRun SCIRun

   Type "cd ~/SCIRun" to make sure that this works.

   This link does not need to be called SCIRun.  You can also call
   it scirun or something else more convenient.  To make it called
   "scirun", type:
     ln -s /home/sci/data6/sparker/SCIRun scirun
   instead of the above command.  You will also need to change the
   SCI_WORK variable in the lines which you added to your .cshrc to
   reflect these changes.

7) Configure SCIRun.  First, type:
   chmod +x sci_config
   then,
   sci_config

   This will bring up a simple user interface to SCIRun configuration
   options.

   A typical configuration for the SGI machines is:
   Machine: SGI
   Variant: Debug
   Compiler: Delta        (Always use this on the SGI)
   Assertion Level: 3     (Good for debugging)
   OpenGL: True
   ogl normalizes primitives: True
   Pthreads:		  (No - for now)
   Quarks: False
   Use Sparsellib: False
   Irix binary format:    (Choose the proper format for your machine)

   Choose the Apply button and then the Exit button
 
8) type "xmkmf" to build the initial Makefile

9) type "make World" and wait for it to build.
