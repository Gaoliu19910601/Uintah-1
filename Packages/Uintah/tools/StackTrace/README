The StackTrace program was written to take a stacktrace that includes
addresses by not function names and find the corresponding function
names.  Specifically this happens on Sandia's RedStorm computer.

StackTrace requires a current symbol list of the program in question.
This list MUST be sorted and can be produced in the following manner:

> nm sus | grep -v "      U " | grep -v "       w " | c++filt | sort > sus.symbols.sorted

FYI, StackTrace is to be compiled and run on a linux box (NOT on the
RedStorm compute nodes).
