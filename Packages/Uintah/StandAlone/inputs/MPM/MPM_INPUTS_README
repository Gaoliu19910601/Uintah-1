This is a brief description of the input files in inputs/MPM:

disks.ups  This is the standard disks problem which we've been running
since the first MPM code.  Excercises CompMooneyRivlin Constitutive
Model.

disksel.ups Same as disks.ups except the CompNeoHook constitutive
model is used.

disksplas.ups Same as disks.ups except the CompNeoHookPlas constitutive
model is used.

disks_4patch.ups Same as disks.ups except that it uses 4 patches to solve
the problem.  Should give identical answers to disks.ups.

disks2mat.ups This differs from disks.ups in that each disk is a separate
velocity field and they interact via the friction contact algorithm.

heatcond.ups  Problem to test heat conduction in a bar, with one side
hot, one side cold.  They should go to equilibrium over time.

heatcond2mat.ups  Same as heatcond.ups, but uses separate 
materials, and thus temperature fields for the hot and cold sides.
This exercises the thermal contact algorithm.

inclined_plane_sphere.ups  Sphere rolling down and inclined plane.
This exercises the frictional contact algorithm.  X-position in
CenterOfMassPosition.dat should compare well with the function
17408.*(2.+2.525*x**2).

twomatburn.ups  Two adjacent materials, one burnable, the other inert.
The first starts at 0 degrees, the latter at 100.  The second material
is next to a 300 degree wall, as heat conducts through it, and into
the first material, via the thermal contact algorithm, the first material
ignites and burns away.
