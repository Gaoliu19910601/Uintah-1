HOW TO CREATE A COMPLEX GEOMETRY AND INCORPORATE IT IN UINTAH
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 3 main steps to creating and incorporating a complex geometry piece into 
an MPMICE calculation.

1)  Generate the complex geometry.
 __________________________________
You can use any CAD package that will generate an output file that can be imported
into Fluent/Gambit.  A variety of file formats can be used, these instructions
have been tested with the IGES format.  Please see Gambit->help for more
information on other formats.

If you are going to use Pro-E select a "part" model.  If you don't then you
won't be able to export the geometry piece into the IGES format.  

Gambit does have the ability to generate a complex object but it's not as
sophisticated as Pro-E.  You can create multiple geometric objects and add and
subtract them with boolean operators.  If you elect to use Gambit after you've 
created the object go to step 2.


2)  Generate the triangulated surfaces
------------------------------------
- Open Gambit:  gambit

- Go to File->Import->IGES and select the file.

- If you wish you can translate the geometry object.

- Generate a triangulated surface mesh: 
    - click the mesh command button (2nd button under Operation, yellow block).
    
    - click the face command button (3rd button under Mesh)
        -Select all faces
        -Change "Elements" to Tri (Triangulated faces)
        -Choose an appropriate interval size so the triangulated surface
         accurately represents the geometry piece
   
- Select Solver->Generic to generate a "neu" output file format.

- Export mesh:
  File->Export->Mesh
  <filename>.neu


3) Convert the triangulated mesh into something that Uintah can read.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Copy the <filename>.neu file to your SCIrun directory.

- Run gambitFileReader.  Input the <filename>.neu file name and
then the basename of the output files.  Use the same name minus the
".neu" extension.  For example:


fluids:51# gambitFileReader

**********************************************
Input the name of the Gambit output file: torus.neu
Input the output file name for storing points and surfaces: torus
I've found 4400 nodes and 8800 elements
Node Coordinates
connectivity
I've successfully read in the file


- Copy the geometry <filename>.pts and <filename>.tri files to location of sus.

- Add the geometry to your input file in the same fashion as you would a 
box, cylinder, sphere.
