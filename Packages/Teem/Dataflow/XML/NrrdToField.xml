    <summary>Given all the information stored about the input nrrd
output a field of the appropriate type.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>
          If a mesh is stored in the NrrdData, and the nrrd data still
maps to that mesh, create a field using that mesh. Otherwise for
3three dimensional nrrd data create a LatVolField, for two dimensional
nrrd data create an ImageField, and for one dimensional data create a
ScanlineField. The created field is the output for this module. The
user interface has options much like unu slice.
