      <p>Convert nrrd to another type (as if by per-value cast). This
does not transform, scale, clamp, or intelligently quantize values; it just
copies them from one type to another, which replicates exactly what you'd get
in C when you assign from a variable of one type to another, or when you cast
to a differet type. See also unu quantize,unu 2op x, and unu 3op clamp.</p>
      <p>New Type : specify the type to convert to.</p>
