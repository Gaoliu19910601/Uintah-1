    <summary>Normalize tensor size.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Normalize tensor size. This operates on the eigenvalues of the
tensor, and allows normalizing some user-defined weighting of the
eigenvalues by some user-defined amount .</p>
     <p>Major : relative weights to put on major eigenvalue when performing normalization
     (internally rescaled to have a 1.0 L1 norm). This weightings determines the
     tensors's size. Value should be a float.</p>
     <p>Medium : relative weights to put on medium eigenvalue when performing normalization
     (internally rescaled to have a 1.0 L1 norm). This weightings determines the
     tensors's size. Value should be a float.</p>
     <p>Minor :relative weights to put on minor eigenvalue when performing normalization
     (internally rescaled to have a 1.0 L1 norm). This weightings determines the
     tensors's size. Value should be a float.</p>
     <p>Amount : how much of the normalization to perform. Should be a float.</p>
     <p>Target : target size, post normalization. This value should be a float.</p>
