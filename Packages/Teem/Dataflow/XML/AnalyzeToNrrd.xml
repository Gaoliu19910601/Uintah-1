    <summary>Convert Analyze data to the NRRD format which can be used in 
SCIRun networks.

    <description>
      <p> This module provides support for converting 
<a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/Common/analyze_fmt.shtml">Analyze</a>
data to the <a href="http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/index.html">NRRD</a> 
format which can be used in SCIRun networks. An important point is that this 
module is dependent on the Insight package, so both the Teem and Insight 
packages have to be enabled in the SCIRun build in order for the AnalyzeToNrrd 
converter to work.
      </p> 
      <p> Some brief background information about the Analyze format will be 
helpful in understanding how to load data using the AnalyzeToNrrd reader.  For 
a detailed description of the Analyze format, please refer to the documentation
pages for 
<a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Imaging/Common/analyze_fmt.shtml">Analyze</a>.
      </p>
      <p> Analyze files contain volume data, often from MRI.  The Analyze
format includes two different files for each volume:  a header (extension 
".hdr") file and and image (extension ".img") file.  All of the image data for 
a volume is contained in a single image file.  Since these files come in pairs,
the AnalyzeToNrrd module requires the user to specify a ".hdr" file to read.  
Then the module looks for the corresponding ".img" file in the same directory 
as the ".hdr" file.  
      </p>
      <p> The AnalyzeToNrrd module requires the user to specify a directory 
containing the data files.  One or more Analyze files may be selected for 
processing.  If the files are recognized as valid Analyze format, they are read
in and converted to the NRRD format which can then be passed downstream to 
certain other SCIRun modules.
