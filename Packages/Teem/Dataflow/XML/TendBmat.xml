    <summary>Calculate B-matrix given gradient directions.</summary>
    <description>
      <p>Calculate B-matrix given gradient directions, assuming no
diffusion weighting from the other imaging gradients. The input is a 3-by-N
array of floats or doubles, each row being one of the gradient directions used
for diffusion-weighted imaging. A plain text file with one gradient per line,
no punctuation, is an easy way to specify this information. The gradient
vector coefficients are used as is, without normalization (since different
gradient strengths are sometimes desired). The output has one row of the
B-matrix per line, with coefficient ordering Bxx, Bxy, Bxz, Byy, Byz, Bzz, and
with the off-diagonal elements NOT pre-multiplied by 2.</p>
