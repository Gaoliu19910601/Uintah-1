    <summary>Convert DICOM data to the NRRD format which can be used in SCIRun 
networks.
    </summary>
    <description>
      <p> This module provides support for converting 
<a href="http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/cr1/dicom.html">DICOM</a>
data to the <a href="http://teem.sourceforge.net/nrrd/index.html">NRRD</a> 
format which can be used in SCIRun networks. An important point is that this 
module is dependent on the Insight package, so both the Teem and Insight 
packages have to be enabled in the SCIRun build in order for the DicomNrrdReader 
converter to work.
      </p> 
      <p> Some brief background information about the DICOM format will be 
helpful in understanding how to load data using the DicomNrrdReader reader.  For a 
detailed description of the DICOM format, please refer to the documentation 
pages for 
<a href="http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/cr1/dicom.html">DICOM</a>.Also, note that the DICOM format is "flexible", meaning that implementations 
tend to vary slightly, so the descriptions that follow are not guaranteed to be
universally applicable.
      </p>
      <p> DICOM is a standard file format that stores volume data from computed
tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound.  Each 
DICOM file has a header that is followed by image data.   While a single DICOM 
file can contain image data for multiple slices of scanned data, usually each 
DICOM file contains only one image frame corresponding to one slice.  For 
example, for a scan consisting of 60 slices, there would most likely be 60 
DICOM files.  This logical grouping of DICOM files is called a series.  As a 
result, when loading DICOM data using the DicomNrrdReader module, one or more 
series' each containing one or more files can be loaded.
      </p>
      <p> The DicomNrrdReader module requires the user to specify a directory 
containing the data files.  One or more series' of DICOM files can be selected 
for processing.  If the files are recognized as valid DICOM format, they are 
read in and converted to the NRRD format which can then be passed downstream to
certain other SCIRun modules.
