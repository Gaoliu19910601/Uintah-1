    <summary>
      <p>
The Nrrd Field Converter creates a SCIRun mesh and field from Nrrd
data. It makes assumptions about the field and mesh type based on the
input data. The mesh data must be properly attributed with SCIRun
properties for the mesh to be created.

      <p>
The Nrrd Field Converter creates a SCIRun mesh and field from the
data. It makes assumptions about the field and mesh type based on the
input data.
      </p>
      <p>
For a mesh to be created each point component(s) must contain the
following properties:
      </p>
<p>Coordinate System - {Cartesian - XYZ}</p>
<p>Topology - {Structured or Unstructured}</p>
<p>If the Topology is Structured a geometry property is also needed:</p>
<p>Geometry - {Regular or Irregular}</p>

<p>If the data is Unstructured a connectivity list is needed with the
follow properties:</p>
<p>Topology - {Unstructured}</p>
<p>Cell Type - { Tetahedron, Pyramid, Prism, Hexahedron,
                 Triangle,Quadrilateral, Curve, Point }</p>


<p>For a structured mesh, the points may be given as either components
or as an n dimensional array by 2, or 3.</p>


<p>If no mesh is present and the user has selected the "No Mesh"
option a regular mesh from 0 to 1 will be created.</p>


<p>Field data is not requied, but if present, it need not have any
properties and can not have a property "Topology" which is reserved
only for mesh data. Further it may be sent as either scalar, vector,
or tensor or as individual components. If sent as components there
must be either 1, 3, or 6 inputs and each must be scalar.</p>


<p>For all inputs the Nrrd data may be send individually or along
a multiple tuple axis. Sending along multiple tuple axis redeuces the
number connections needed between modules.</p>
