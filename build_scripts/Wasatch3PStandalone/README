This directory contains scripts to allow for updating, building, and installing the
Wasatch3P libraries outside of Uintah.  This set of scripts is stored in the Uintah
SVN repository under src/build_scripts/Wasatch3PStandalone/.  It should be checked
out into the Wasatch3P git directory using:

[ Might need --force to get it to insert itself into the directory structure that
  is already in place. ]

svn co https://gforge.sci.utah.edu/svn/uintah/trunk/src/build_scripts/Wasatch3PStandalone .

SpatialOps
ExprLib
TabProps (though TabProps doesn't actually depend on either of the other two)
RadProps

And uses: 'git pull' to update code.
