Things to be done soon. Feedback on any or all of the following
is welcome.

1. A native Mach port

2. Add more coherency protocols

3. Try tuning applications by running with multiple protocols on a per
   page basis. Things to worry about is the correct mix of protocols,
   how to determine the "right" protocol for a page, how to secify
   that, etc. 

4. Clean up the programming interface. Due to the inadequacy of Quarks
   fork semantics, porting of Splash programs become a little
   involved. The programming interface should be improved, by making
   it more closer to Unix fork semantics. 

5. Try more applications. Benchmarks other than Splash programs are 
   very much needed. Any suggestions regarding this will be
   appreciated. 

6. Try out more efficient threads package. Also, try out a more
   efficient and low latency network protocol.

7. Compare with PVM applications. In order to attract the scientific
   community, it is essential to compare with PVM and show that Quarks
   provides simpler programming interface while not degrading the
   performance by a large factor.
