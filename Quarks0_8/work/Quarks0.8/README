****************************************************************************
        Quarks Distributed Shared Memory system, Ver 0.8, Apr 15 1995
****************************************************************************


NOTE:
----
This is a Beta release 0.8 of Quarks.  We are currently in the process
of further testing and porting the system.  Changes to the code and
programming interface are possible.  Feedback, fixes, and improvements
from beta testers are especially welcome at this stage.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
-------------------
   The various subdirectories are as follows:

      src: contains the source code for the Quarks library and server
      include: header files
      bin: the sh_server executable
      lib: libraries libquarks and libcthreads 
      doc: documentation
      splash: ANL macros for Quarks and Water and Mp3d ported to Quarks
      src/cthreads: contains the cthreads code for different platforms

HOW TO BUILD QUARKS:
-------------------
Quarks currently runs on SunOS 4.1, HP-UX on HP700's, and on Irix 5.2.
The compiler we used was GNU gcc 2.5.8 for sun and hpux, and ANSI
ucode C compiler for Irix.

To build the Quarks shared memory server and the quarks library:

$ cd src
$ make -f Makefile.{sunos,hpux,irix} libquarks.a sh_server


To build an application (eg matmult):

$ cd src
$ make -f Makefile.{sunos,hpux,irix} matmult

HOW TO RUN APPLICATIONS ON QUARKS:
---------------------------------
For full details, see the user manual.

1. Start the server "sh_server" on a machine (say A)
2. Create a file "Qk.hosts" in the directory containing the
   application executable.  This file contains the names of machines on
   which you want the slave threads to be created.  See the user_manual
   for details of each entry.
3. If xterms are desired for the slave threads, set the DISPLAY
   environment variable.
4. If control over the size and location of displayed xterms is
   desired, create a file "Qk.display" in the directory containing the
   application executable, as described in the user manual.  This file
   is optional.
5. Run the application program from the "src" directory. Quarks
   parameters can be provided at the command line by appending a "--"
   to application command line arguments and specifying Quarks
   parameters after that. The -s parameter specifies the hostname on 
   which the server is running (A in this case). 

To run under gdb, follow steps 1 through 4 and start gdb.  Run the
process at the root node with the -g quarks flag (see the user manual
for description of quarks flags and the convention to specify them).
Run the child processes (under gdb) with the command line arguments
required by the application followed by -c flag (to indicate it is a
child process) at the end. 


SUGGESTIONS AND BUGS:
--------------------
Please feel free to contact us at quarks-bugs@cs.utah.edu for further
help or clarification.  All bug reports, suggestions, etc should be
directed to the above address.  See the TODO file for areas of work.
