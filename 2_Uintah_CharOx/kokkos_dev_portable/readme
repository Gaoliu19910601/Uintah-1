these are portable version from kokkos_dev branch. Can run on KNL and GPU P100.
GPU results of CharOx originate from this code.
KNL version is little slower than trunk version. It give 6x instead of 7.8x.

modified_src_y:  there are no threads along x dimension of cuda and memory reads are strided. best works for LVL=2, PVL=1 (default)
modified_src:    using actual simd_type with x dimension threads. works best for elements per vector lane = 2 and PVL=1, 2 or 4. comparable to modified_src_y.
