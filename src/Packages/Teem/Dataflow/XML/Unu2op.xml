    <summary>Binary operation on two nrrds, or on a nrrd and a constant. Either
the first or second operand can be a float constant, but not both. Use - for
an operand to signify a nrrd to be read from stdin (a pipe). Note, however,
that - can probably only be used once (reliably).</summary>
    <description>
    <p>Operator: Binary operator. Possibilities include:
           +, -, x, / : add, subtract, multiply, divide;
           ^ : exponentiation (pow);
           % : integer modulo;
           fmod : same as fmod() in C;
           atan2 : same as atan2() in C;
           min, max: minimum, maximum;
           lt, lte, gt, gte : same as C's less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to;
           eq, neq : same as C's == and !=;
           comp : -1, 0, or 1 if 1st value is less than, equal to, or
             greater than 2nd value;
           exists : if 1st value exists, use it, else use 2nd value</p>
     <p>Float Input : This value is used in the operation and can be on the left or right side of the operator depending on the value of Use Nrrd as First Input.</p>
     <p>Use Nrrd as First Input : This checkbox indicates if the Nrrd should be on the left or right side of the operator.  A value of checked will indicate that the InputNrrd should be on the left side of the operator.</p>
