Exceptions.h is an interface to the exception mechanism.  Since most
compilers currently do not implement exceptions, we must resort to our
own mechanism, and simultaneously provide a means for transition in
the future.  An exception is generated like this:

EXCEPTION( exception object );


Exception Classes
-----------------

There are several classes of exceptions.  More may be defined as
necessary.  All of these classes are inherited from the AllExceptions
class.  

AssertionFailed - used by Assert.h for a failed assertion.  Prints the
	expression which caused the failure.
	AssertionFailed(char* condition);
AssertionEQFailed - used by Assert.h for a failed equals assertion.
	Prints the expression which caused the failure, plus the value
	of both variables. 
	AssertionEQFailed(char* c1, char* c2, int v1, int v2);
AssertionRangeFailed - used by Assert.h for an our of range failure.
	Prints the range as well as the text and values of the
	expression and the upper/lower bounds of the range.
	AssertionRangeFailed(char* exp_text, char* lower_text,
		char* upper_text, int exp, int lower, int upper);
ErrorOpeningFile - When you can't find that important file... Prints
	the name of the file.
	ErrorOpeningFile(char* name);
UnInitialized - When a class is being used without being initialized.
	This helps catch a lot of errors with the Point/Vecor classes.
	Uninitialized(char* name);
General - Everything else.
	General(char* name);
