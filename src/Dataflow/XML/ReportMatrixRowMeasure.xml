      Apply an operator on each row of the matrix. 
      This module implements the following operations: 
      Sum, Mean, Variance, Median, Maximum, Minimum, and Norm.
      The output of the module is a vector with the results of these
      operators applied to each row of the matrix. The output
      is a matrix with one column and the same number of rows as
      the input.
