Release Note Summary - SCIRun Version 1.20 - Oct 27, 2003

New Projects in Version 1.20
----------------------------

- Support for the NLM Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit
  (www.itk.org)!  Many Insight Filters are wrapped with SCIRun
  modules.  SCIRun infrastructure updated to easily allow wrapping of
  new filters.  See Chapter 8 of the Users Guide on how to use ITK
  Filters. For source distributions, Insight must be installed
  separately.  See the installation guide on how to install Insight.
  The RPM distribution includes Insight.

- New stand alone SCIRun Power Apps!  These applications hide the
  complexities of the powerful SCIRun dataflow interface, allowing the
  user to focus on a specific task.  Currently there are two Power
  Apps.  BioTensor and BioFEM.

  * BioTensor is used for doing Diffusion Tensor Imaging.  This
    application takes the user from data acquisition, through
    registration and building diffusion tensors.  In addition, several
    visualization techniques such as Planes, Isosurfaces, Glyphs and
    Fibers are provided to allow the user to investigate the data.

  * BioFEM is an encapsulation of the forward-fem network that is
    included in the BioPSE package and described in the BioPSE
    Tutorial.  With BioFEM, the user can run finite element
    bioelectric field simulations based on volume conductor models and
    dipolar sources, and can interactively visualize the simulation
    results with electric field streamlines and isopotential surfaces.

- Upgraded the Network Editor to be much more user friendly.  See
  "Network Editor" below.

Data Sets
---------
* New "insight" directory with sample data for Insight nets.
* New "brain-dt" directory with sample data for the BioTensor Power App.

Network Editor Enhancements
---------------------------

  The SCIRun Dataflow Network Editor has been reworked to make use
much easier.  New features include the ability to select multiple
modules and group them.  These grouped modules can be merged into a
Sub-Network (also known as a Macro Module) allowing for the ability to
more easily deal with complex networks.  Modules and pipes can now be
disabled to temporarily turn off parts of comlex networks.  Pipes and
modules can be annotated on the Network Editor canvas to help make the
dataflow layout easier to understand.  A basic undo feature has been
added allowing the user to undo/redo the creation/deletion of pipe
connections.  Tool tips have been added to may widgets.
