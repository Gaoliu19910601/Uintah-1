    <title>Loading Data</title>
    <para>Loading a dataset is very easy.  Upon opening BioImage, the
    first module visible on the left-hand panel is the Load Data
    window.  To load data, in this case the Tooth CT data, select the
    Nrrd tab.  This will automatically allow BioImage to properly
    process the Nrrd datatype.  Please see the BioImage Reference
    Guide for more instruction on loading other types of data.  After
    selecting the Nrrd tab, press the "Browse" button to open the File
    Selection Dialog.  Navigate to the proper location and select the
    "tooth.nhdr" file.  After selecting the proper dataset, press the
    "Set" button to load the data.  After selecting the dataset,
    simply press the green "Update" button to complete the process of
    loading the data into BioImage.  Although the data might be
    displayed in the view windows, the loading process is not complete
    until the "Update" button is clicked.</para>

    <para>After loading the data into BioImage, the 4 view windows
    will contain visualizations of the data.  The upper-left window
    will contain a 3D reconstruction of the data, while the other
    three windows will present 3 different, orthogonal, slices of the
    data.  These three windows can be manipulated by the "Viewing
    Cube."  The Viewing Cube, located in the Load Data window, allows
    the user to change the orientation of the slices presented in the
    3 windows.  The orientation of each view can be changed by
    altering the abbreviation next to the proper arrow.  By default,
    the axial, sagittal, and coronal slices are view from the
    superior, anterior, left views respectively.  To change this,
    simply select the appropriate arrow, change the value, and then
    click the cube button in the middle.  This will change all four
    views in the drawing space.  The valid options are:</para>
    <simplelist type="vert" columns="1">
      <member>S: Superior</member>
      <member>I: Inferior</member>
      <member>A: Anterior</member>
      <member>P: Posterior</member>
      <member>L: Left</member>
      <member>R: Right</member>
    </simplelist>
    <para>To reset the views to the default parameters, simply press
    the "Reset" button in the lower right corner of the Load Data
    window.</para>

    <title>Dynamic Filters</title>
    <para>BioImage focuses on data display, interaction, and
    manipulation.  This is all possible through the use of Dynamic
    Filters.  The various filters available are located at the top of
    the left hand pane.  These filters, Resample, Crop, Histogram, and
    CMedian allow finer control over the interaction and manipulation
    of the data displayed in the visualization windows.</para>

    <para>To add a Resample filter, click the "Resample" button.  A
    new window will appear immediately below the Load Data window.
    This window allows for resampling in each dimension as well as a
    parameterized method for resampling.  To downsample this data set
    in each dimension, change the "x1" to "x0.5" in each dimension.
    This will resample the dataset to 1/2 of the samples in each
    dimension.</para>

    <para>Click the "Update" button to finalize and apply the Resample
    filter.</para>

    <para>To add a cropping filter, click the "Crop" button.  A new
    window will appear immediately below the Resample filter.  Also,
    notice that a set of boxes appears over the dataset in the display
    pane.  The extents of the various boxes present a visual
    indication of the area of the dataset that will remain after the
    application of the Cropping filter.  The small yellow circles at
    the corners can be clicked-and-dragged in order to interactively
    change the size of the cropping filter.</para>

    <para>Click the "Update" button to finalize and apply the Crop
    filter to the Resampled dataset.</para>

    <para>Notice that each of these filters are applied sequentially
    from the Load Data window to the last filter in the list.  To
    remove a filter from the list of filters to apply to the data,
    simply select the filter by clicking in its window, and then
    clicking the red "Delete" button.  This will remove the filter
    from the pipeline completely.</para>

    <para>Click the "Update" button to finalize and apply the new
    filter rules.  Only after clicking the Update button will any
    changes made to the data be applied to the data being
    visualized.</para>
