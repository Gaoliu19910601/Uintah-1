<H2><A NAME="section_1"> Section 1 -- Introduction </H2>

The BioFEM application is an example standalone program used for
computing the electric field in a volume given a set of dipoles.  The
intent of this program is to demonstrate wrapping the BioPSE Tutorial
example up as a Power Application.

<P>
TODO: Describe what FEM is here.


<H2><A NAME="section_2"> Section 2 -- Getting Started </H2>

In this section we describe how to get started using BioFEM.
Subsequent sections will cover the various features and functions of
the software, along with snapshots of the software in action.

<BR><H3><A NAME="section_2_1"> 2.1 SCIRun Environment Variables </H3>

It is highly recommended that you get started with the SCIRun datasets
(available from http://software.sci.utah.edu/scirun-datasets.html)
with BioFEM.  You are, of course, also encourage to use BioFEM to
investigate your own datasets.  Details of how to import data into
BioFEM will be provided in Section 3.  If you do choose to use the
example SCIRun datasets, set your SCIRUN_DATA environment variable to
point to the location of the data prior to running BioFEM.

<BR><H3><A NAME="section_2_2"> 2.2 Launching BioFEM </H3>

To launch the BioFEM application, 'cd' into the directory in which
the BioFEM executable is located (if you have done an RPM
installation, that directory is /usr/local/SCIRun/bin/), and then type
'./BioFEM'.  The BioFEM application will take a few moments to
start up, and will launch a user interface window like the one shown
in <A HREF="#figure_1">Figure 1</A>.

<BR><H3><A NAME="section_2_3"> 2.3 User Interface Organization </H3>

The user interface for the BioFEM application has a lighter layout
than the typical SCIRun/BioPSE PowerApp.  On the left there is a
Rendering window where all of the data interaction and
visualization is performed.  And on the right there is a
Visualization Pane from which you can control many of the parameters
for the Rendering window.  Because it is often desirable to view the
Rendering window at full-screen resolution, we have added support for
detaching and reattaching these two panes by clicking on the
vertical dashed lines between them.  When separated, the panes appear
as shown in <A HREF="#figure_2">Figure 2.</A>

<P>
At the top of the Rendering window there are two top-level menu
options: File and Help, as shown in <A HREF="#figure_3">Figures 3</A>
and <A HREF ="#figure_4">4</A>.  These menus contain options for loading and
saving BioFEM settings, as well as options for controlling the
appearance of 'tooltips' within BioFEM.

<P>
At the bottom of the Visualization Pane, there is a Progress Indicator
and a text description which indicate the current state of the
application.  Just above the Progress Indicator is a blue Execute
button.  The Execute button can be pressed to compute the electric
field for the selected models, and should be pressed after the
filenames are correct.


<BR><H2><A NAME="section_3"> Section 3: Loading Data </H2>

TODO: About data sets.
<P>
Once the File entries are pointing to the correct data locations,
press the Execute button at the bottom of the pane to load the data
into the system.  Once the data is loaded, an image will appear in the
Rendering window.  This image shows the outer boundary of the volume
and the dipoles, as well as the electrode set from the electrode field
file, the isosurface at zero voltage, and some streamlines that follow
the voltage gradients.  The electrodes, isosurface, and streamlines
are color coded by default such that negative voltages are blue and
positive voltages are red.


<BR><H2><A NAME="section_4"> Section 4: Visualization </H2>

After the dataset is selected some computation is done to solve the
forward problem and then the results are visualized.  This may take
several minutes during which time the Progress indicator will indicate
that the system is busy and what it is doing.  The first result that
should appear is the outer shell of the volume in a translucent grey.
You can begin interacting with the visualization at any time, but
waiting for the progress to be "Completed" (green) is more useful as
that is when everything will be visible.

<BR><H3><A NAME="section_4_1"> 4.1 Rendering Window </H3>

The visualization data for the SCIRunData datasets should come up in
the correct location.  If not you can begin visualizing the data by
pressing the AutoView button to move the rendered geometry into the
middle of the window.  The Autoview button is located on the Viewer
Options tab, but can also be invoked by pressing Ctrl-V while the
mouse is in the Rendering window.  The controls for navigating within
the Rendering window are the same as for the SCIRun ViewWindow
(http://software.sci.utah.edu/doc/User/Guide/usersguide/srug5.html#sec:viewer)
though the full control pane normally found at the bottom of the
ViewWindow has been replaced with the most frequently used subset of
those controls and is now located on the Viewer Options tab.
<P>
Within the Vis Options tab of the Visualization pane, there are four categories for controlling the visualization settings.  We will now investigate the options on the four categories:  IsoSurface, StreamLines, Electrodes, and ColorMap.

<BR><H3><A NAME="section_4_2"> 4.2 IsoSurface Visualization </H3>

Selecting the IsoSurface tab reveals the options for generating an
isosurface from the DT volume.  As shown in <A
HREF="#figure_6">Figure 6</A> you can:

<UL> 
   <LI> Choose whether or not to show the isosurface. </LI>
   <LI> Selcted an isovalue. </LI>
   <LI> Enable or disable rendering faces with interpolated normals for smoother renderings.</LI>

<BR><H3><A NAME="section_4_4"> 4.4 Electrodes Visualization </H3>

As with the tensor glyphs, you can select seed locations and
colorization options for rendering fibers within the brain.  A variety
of these options are shown in <A HREF="#figure_14">Figure 14</A>, <A
HREF="#Figure_15"> Figure 15, and <A HREF="#figure_16">Figure 16</A>.
Additionally, you can set a number of parameters that control the
fiber tracing algorithm.  These parameters include:

<UL>
  <LI> Algorithm: trace along the major eigenvector or using the
       tensorlines algorithm; choose a step size, as well as whether
       to use Euler or RK4 (fourth-order Runge-Kutta) integration.

  <LI> Sampling Kernel: when querying tensor values between discrete
       sample locations, the interpolation kernel to be used (Tent,
       Catmull-Rom, or B-Spline).

  <LI> Stopping Criteria: choose a set of criteria which can be
       evaluated to determine whether to terminate a fiber.  If any of
       the criteria are true, the fiber will terminate.  These
       criteria include: exceeding a specified maximum fiber length,
       exceeding a maximum number of steps, and entering a region of
       the volume which falls below a specified anisotropy threshold
       (either Linear Anisotropy or Fractional Anisotropy).
