\section{Packages}
\label{sec:packages}
\index{packages}

Packages are what provide the real utility of \SR{} from most users'
perspectives.  The are sets of modules that use the basic \SR{}
functionality to perform specific tasks such a solving bioelectric
field problems (See also \secref{\SR{} and its
  Packages}{sec:srversuspse}).

\subsection{The \sr{} Package}
\label{sec:srpackage}
\index{SCIRun@\sr{}!package}

The \sr{} package contains these categories:

\begin{description}
\item[\category{DataIO}] Modules for reading and writing \sr{} data
  types.  Use these to read \sr{} type data into a network and write
  data to disk from a network.  These only know about \sr{} type data.
  Non-\sr{} (foreign) data may be converted to \sr{} type data using
  \sr{}'s converter programs (see \secref{Importing data into
    \sr{}}{sec:import} for more information).
  
\item[\category{Fields}] Modules for creating, manipulating, and
  processing field data.  See Section~\ref{sec:field-types} for an
  introduction to \sr{} field types.
  
\item[\category{Math}] Modules providing matrix operations and
  equation solving capabilities.
  
\item[\category{Render}] Modules for visualizing data produced by
  other modules.  The main visualization tool at present
  is the Viewer, which is described in more detail in
  \secref{Visualization with the \viewer{}}{sec:viewer}.
\end{description}

\subsection{The BioPSE Package}
\label{sec:biopsepackage}
\index{SCIRun@\BIOPSE{}!package}


These modules provide you with tools tailored to solving bioelectric field
problems, which is the theme of the \htmladdnormallink{NCRR
center}{http://www.sci.utah.edu/ncrr} we have developed.


\begin{description}
\item[\category{DataIO}] Modules for reading and writing \sr{} data types.
\item[\category{Forward Problems}] Modules for solving forward
  problems in the bioelectric field domain.
\item[\category{Inverse Problems}] Modules for solving inverse problems.
\item[\category{LeadField Calculations}] Modules which support the
  construction and analysis of fields derived from experimental or
  computed data gathered or computed at electrode sensor locations.
\item[\category{Modeling}] Modules which support the construction of
  surface and volume bioelectric field models.
\item[\category{Visualization}] Modules for visualizing bioelectric
  field data.
