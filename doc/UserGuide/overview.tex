\chapter{Overview of Uintah} \label{Sec:Overview} The Uintah
Computational Framework (also referred to as Uintah or the UCF)
consists of a set of software components and libraries that facilitate
the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on Structured
AMR (SAMR) grids using hundreds to thousands of processors.

One of the challenges in designing a parallel, component-based and
multi-physics application is determining how to efficiently decompose
the problem domain. Components, by definition, make local
decisions. Yet parallel efficiency is only obtained through a globally
optimal domain decomposition and scheduling of computational
tasks. Typical techniques include allocating disjoint sets of
processing resources to each component, or defining a single domain
decomposition that is a compromise between the ideal load balance of
multiple components. However, neither of these techniques will achieve
maximum efficiency for complex multi-physics problems.

Uintah uses a non-traditional approach to achieving parallelism by
employing an abstract task graph representation to describe
computation and communication. The task graph is an explicit
representation of the computation and communication that occur in the
coarse of a single iteration of the simulation (typically a timestep
or nonlinear solver iteration). Uintah components delegate decisions
about parallelism to a scheduler component by using variable
dependencies to describe communication patterns and characterizing
computational workloads to facilitate a global resource
optimization. The task graph representation has a number of
advantages, including efficient fine-grained coupling of multi-physics
components, flexible load balancing mechanisms and a separation of
application concerns from parallelism concerns. However, it creates a
challenge for scalability which we overcome by creating an implicit
definition of this graph and representing it in a distributed fashion.

The primary advantage of a component-based approach is that it
facilitates the separate development of simulation algorithms, models,
and infrastructure. Components of the simulation can evolve
independently. The component-based architecture allows pieces of the
system to be implemented in a rudimentary form at first and then
evolve as the technologies mature. Most importantly, Uintah allows the
aspects of parallelism (schedulers, load-balancers, parallel
input/output, and so forth) to evolve independently of the simulation
components. Furthermore, components enable replacement of computation
pieces without complex decision logic in the code itself.
