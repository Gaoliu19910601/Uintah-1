\section{Introduction}

MPMICE is a marriage of the multi-material ICE method, described in
Section~\ref{Sec:ICE} and MPM, described in Section~\ref{Sec:MPM}.
The equations of motion solved for both fluid and solid are essentially
the same, although the physical behavior of these two states of matter
differ, largely due to their constitutive relationships.  MPM is used
to track the evolution of solid materials in a Lagrangian frame of
reference, while fluids are evolved in the Eulerian frame.

\section{Theory - Algorithm Description}

At this time, the reader is directed to the manuscript by Guilkey,
Harman and Banerjee~\cite{fourthmit} for the theoretical and algorithmic
description of the method.

\section{Examples}

\subsection*{\center Mach 2 Wedge}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Mach 2 Wedge}
\subsubsection*{\underline{Problem Description}}
This is a simulation of a symmetric $20^o$ wedge traveling through initially
quiescent air at Mach 2.0.  A shock forms at the leading edge of the
wedge and an expansion fan over its top.  Consultation of oblique shock
tables, e.g.~\cite{ref:Saad} (pp.308-309) reveals that the angle of the leading
shock compares quite well with the expected value.  In addition, this
simulation demonstrates a few other useful features of the fluid-structure
interaction capability.  In this case, the structure is rigid, and as
such, essentially provides a boundary condition to the compressible flow
calculation.  Furthermore, the geometry of the wedge is described via a
triangulated surface, rather than the geometric primitives usually used.
This allows the user to study flow around arbitrarily complex objects,
without the difficulty of generating a body fitted mesh around that object.

\subsection*{\center Cylinder in a Crossflow}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Cylinder in a Crossflow}
\subsubsection*{\underline{Problem Description}}
In this example the domain is initially filled with air moving at a uniform velocity of $0.03m/s$  A ridgid cylinder $O.D. = 0.02m$ is placed $0.1m$ from the inlet and a passive scalar is injected into the domain through a $0.002m$ hole on in the inlet boundary of the domain.  A velocity perturbation is placed upstream of the cylinder to produce an instablity that will help trigger the onset of the K\'arm\'an vortex street.

\subsection*{\center Copper Clad Rate Stick (aka ``Cylinder Test")}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{"Cylinder Test"}
\subsubsection*{\underline{Problem Description}}

This is a two-dimensional version of the ``cylinder test" which is used to
characterize equations of state for explosive products.  In those tests, a
copper tube is filled with a high explosive and a detonation is initiated
at one end.  Various means are used to measure the velocity of the tube as
the high pressure product gases expand inside of it.

Here, a cylinder ($r=2.54 cm$) of QM100 is jacketed with a copper cylinder
that has a wall thickness of $0.52 cm.$   Detonation is initiated by giving
a thin layer of the explosive a high initial velocity in the axial direction
which generates a pressure that is sufficiently high to reach trigger the
detonation model.  As the detonation proceeds, the copper is pushed out of
the domain by the expanding product gases.

Note that in this example, to make run times brief, the domain is very short
in the axial direction, and is probably not sufficient for the detonation to
reach steady state.  Additionally, the domain has been reduced to two
dimensions, as symmetry is assumed in the Z-plane.  Finally, the spatial
resolution of $1.0 mm$ is a bit coarse to achieve 
convergent results.  The full three dimensional result can quickly be
obtained by commenting out the symmetry condition on the z+ plane and
uncommenting the Neumann conditions, as well as changing the spatial extents
and resolution in the Z direction to match those in the Y direction.
