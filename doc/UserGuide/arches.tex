\chapter{Arches}

\section{Introduction}

The Arches component solves a low-mach formulation with a pressure
projection of the Navier-Stokes equations for turbulent, variable
density, reacting flows. Turbulent flow scales are modeled using a
Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach. Chemistry is handled using chemistry
parameterization and closure models for subgrid scale mixing. Modes
of heat transfer include radiation. blah blah blah


\section{Theory - Algorithm Description}

The essential governing equations for the Arches component, written
in finite volume form, include the mass balance, momentum balance,
mixture fraction balance, and energy balance equations. Using a bold-face
symbol to represent a vector quantity, the equations are: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The mass balance, \begin{equation}
\int_{V}\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}dV+\oint_{S}\rho\mathbf{u}\cdot d\mathbf{S}=0\;,\label{eqn:mass_balance}\end{equation}
 where $\rho$ is density and $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector. 
\item The momentum balance, \begin{equation}
\int_{V}\frac{\partial\rho\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}dV+\oint_{S}\rho\mathbf{uu}\cdot d\mathbf{S}=\oint_{S}\tau\cdot d\mathbf{S}-\int_{V}\nabla pdV+\int_{V}\rho\mathbf{g}dV\;,\label{eqn:mom_balance}\end{equation}
 where $\tau$ is the deviatoric stress tensor defined as $\tau_{ij}=2\mu S_{ij}-\frac{2}{3}\mu\frac{\partial u_{k}}{\partial x_{k}}\delta_{ij}$,
the second isotropic term in $\tau_{ij}$ is absorbed into the pressure
projection for the current low-Mach scheme, and $S_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}+\frac{\partial u_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}\right)$.
Also in Equation \ref{eqn:mom_balance}, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational
body force and $p$ is pressure. 
\item The mixture fraction balance, \begin{equation}
\int_{V}\frac{\partial\rho f}{\partial t}dV+\oint_{S}\rho\mathbf{u}f\cdot d\mathbf{S}=\oint_{S}D\nabla f\cdot d\mathbf{S}\;,\label{eqn:species_balance}\end{equation}
 where $f$ is the mixture fraction and a Fick's law form of the diffusion
term assuming equal diffusivities results in a single diffusion coefficient,
$D$. 
\item The thermal energy balance, \begin{equation}
\int_{V}\frac{\partial\rho h}{\partial t}dV+\oint_{S}\rho\mathbf{u}h\cdot d\mathbf{S}=\oint_{S}k\nabla h\cdot d\mathbf{S}-\oint_{S}q\cdot d\mathbf{S}\;,\label{eqn:heat_balance}\end{equation}
 where $h$ is the sum of the chemical plus sensible enthalpy, $q$
is the radiative flux, a Fourier's law form of the conduction term
is used with a diffusion coefficient, $k$, and the pressure term
is neglected. 
\end{enumerate}
These equations are solved in an LES context, meaning filters are
applied to the equations. Here, we use Favre filtering, defined as
\[
\overline{\phi}=\frac{\overline{\rho\phi}}{\overline{\rho}},\]
 to isolate the density in the filtered equations. The filtering operations
result in the classic turbulence closure problem and thus models are
required. The model options are for Arches are discussed below. 

The set of filtered equations are discretized in space and time and
solved on a staggered, finite volume mesh. The staggering scheme consists
of four offset grids. One grid stores the scalar quantities and the
remaining three grids store each component of the velocity vector.
The velocity components are situated so that the center of their control
volume is located on the face centers of the scalar grid in their
respective direction. 

The equations are solved in an explicit manner.
