<title>Downloading and Unpacking Sources</title>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>

<para>
Obtain the source code for &sr; and any desired packages.  Be sure
to get the <quote>third party</quote> sources too.  The compressed
tarballs for these sources can be downloaded from SCI's <ulink
url="http://software.sci.utah.edu/archive_entry.html">software
archive</ulink> page.
</para>

</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Unpack the &sr; tarball in a directory of your choice:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
gunzip -c &sr;.x.x.x.tar.gz | tar xf -
</literallayout>
This will create a directory called <filename>&sr;</filename>. Below
we use the term <quote>&sr;</quote> when referring to this
directory (ignoring its full pathname).
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Unpack the compressed package tarballs into
<filename>&sr;/src/Packages</filename>, for example:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
gunzip -c BioPSE.PKG.x.x.x.tar.gz | (cd &sr;/src/Packages &amp;&amp; tar xf -)
</literallayout>
to unpack the BioPSE package.
</para>
<note>
<title>Note</title>
<para><xref linkend="lsrcvs"/> discusses a method for putting the
downloaded &sr; sources under control of the CVS version control
system.  This is useful if you will be writing modules or other &sr;
code.  This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> a requirement for installing
&sr; though!</para>
</note>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Unpack the third party tarball.
<literallayout class="monospaced">
gunzip -c Thirdparty_install.x.x.x.tar.gz | tar xf -
</literallayout>
</para>
</listitem>

</orderedlist>

<section>
<title>Building Third Party Software</title>

<para>Third party software must be built before building &sr;.  Follow
these steps:</para>

<para>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
<command>cd</command> to the third party software directory:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
cd Thirdparty_install.x.x.x
</literallayout>
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Run the third party installation script:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
python install <replaceable>dir</replaceable> <replaceable>OS-name</replaceable> <replaceable>compiler</replaceable> <replaceable>32|64</replaceable> <replaceable>jobs</replaceable>
</literallayout>
where <replaceable>dir</replaceable> is the directory in which the
third-party software will be installed (although it is actually
installed in a sub-directory of the specified one),
<replaceable>OS-name</replaceable> is the name of the OS (Irix or
Linux), <replaceable>compiler</replaceable> is your compiler's name and
version (e.g. gcc-3.04), <replaceable>32|64</replaceable> specifies
one of 32 bit or 64 bit binaries, and <replaceable>jobs</replaceable>
is the number of jobs that make will create when building the
software.  For example:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
python install /usr/local/&sr;_Third_Party Irix CC 64 2
</literallayout>
or
<literallayout class="monospaced">
python install /usr/local/&sr;_Third_Party Linux gcc-3.1 32 1
</literallayout>
When finished, the installation script will display the complete name
of the third-party software installation directory&mdash;make note of
this value.  
</para>
<note>
The name of the third-party installation directory
reflects the parameters given to the install script.  This allows you
to maintain multiple third-party installations for different operating
systems and machine architectures.
</note>
<para>You may reinstall part or all of the third-party software by
repeating the previous command.  You will be asked to replace all or
part of the installation. Just answer <userinput>y</userinput> or
<userinput>n</userinput> to the script until you have selected the
exact reinstallation you wish.</para>

</listitem>

</orderedlist>

</para>

<section>
<title>Building &sr;</title>

<orderedlist>

<listitem>

<para>
Run &sr;'s configure script.  This can be done from the
<filename>&sr;/src</filename> directory:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
cd &sr;/src
./configure --with-thirdparty=<replaceable>third-party-dir</replaceable> \
--enable-package="<replaceable>package-name1 package-name2 &hellip;</replaceable>"
</literallayout>
or from another directory, for example a sub-directory of &sr;:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
mkdir &sr;/<replaceable>dir</replaceable>
cd &sr;/<replaceable>dir</replaceable>
../src/configure --with-thirdparty=<replaceable>third-party-dir</replaceable> \ 
--enable-package="<replaceable>package-name1 package-name2 &hellip;</replaceable>"
</literallayout>
in which case &sr; will be built in the directory
<filename>&sr;/<replaceable>dir</replaceable></filename> (where
<replaceable>dir</replaceable> is a directory name).
Above,
<replaceable>third-party-dir</replaceable> is replaced by the name of
the third party software installation directory and
"<replaceable>package-name1 package-name2 &hellip;</replaceable>" is
replaced by a list of (previously downloaded and unpacked) package
names , e.g. "BioPSE MatlabInterface".  For example:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
../src/configure --with-thirdparty=/usr/local/&sr;_Third_Party/1.4.2/Irix/CC-32bit \
                 --enable-package="BioPSE"
</literallayout>
</para>

<para>
It is useful to run the configure script from directories other than
<filename>&sr;/src</filename> so that you can build multiple
versions of &sr; from a single source directory.  For example, you may
wish to build a Linux version and 32 bit and 64 bit Irix versions.
Assuming <filename>&sr;</filename> resides on a volume shared by
all machines you may do this:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
mkdir &sr;/linux
mkdir &sr;/sgi32
mkdir &sr;/sgi64
</literallayout>
Then, after logging onto the Linux machine:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
cd &sr;/linux
../src/configure <replaceable>options</replaceable>
</literallayout>
Then from the Irix machine(s):
<literallayout class="monospaced">
cd &sr;/sgi32
../src/configure <replaceable>options</replaceable>
cd &sr;/sgi64
../src/configure --enable-64bit <replaceable>options</replaceable>
</literallayout>
</para>

<para>
There are many options to the configure command in addition to the
<option>--with-thirdparty</option> and
<option>--enable-package</option> options you have already seen.
<xref linkend="appendix"/> lists many of them.
</para>

</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
Run (GNU) make from the directory used previously when running
configure (e.g. &sr;/linux, &sr;/sgi32, or &sr;/sgi64). Note
that the <quote>configure</quote> directory will be called
<replaceable>BUILD_DIR</replaceable> from now on.
<literallayout class="monospaced">
cd <replaceable>BUILD_DIR</replaceable>
make
</literallayout>
Be sure that <command>make</command> invokes GNU make.  GNU make may
be named <command>gmake</command> or <command>gnumake</command> on
your system.
</para>

<para>
For a multiprocessor system you can use GNU make's <option>-j</option>
option to reduce the build time:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
make -j <replaceable>N</replaceable>
</literallayout>
where <replaceable>N</replaceable> is the number of processors
available for use by make.  Using this option on a multiprocessor
machine will often significantly reduce the time to build &sr;.

<title id="dyncomptitle">Dynamic Compilation</title> 

<para>Before executing &sr; you
should be aware of a feature called <firstterm>Dynamic
Compilation</firstterm>.</para> 

<para>Dynamic compilition is a technique used by &sr; that discovers
and generates code for the data types and algorithms used by modules
in your networks.  This is done at runtime and is done once for each
new data type and algorithm encountered.  This technique provides a
number of benefits not discussed here.</para>

<para>By default, code generated by dynamic compilation is stored in
the directory
<filename><replaceable>BUILD_DIR</replaceable>/on-the-fly-libs</filename>.
The location of dynamically generated code can be changed (and doing
so provides a number of benefits&mdash;see below) by setting
the value of the environment variable
<envar>SCI_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS_DIR</envar> to the desired directory, for
example:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
SCI_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS_DIR=$HOME/on-the-fly-libs; export SCI_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS_DIR
</literallayout>
for Bourne-like shells (sh, ksh, bash, etc.) or
<literallayout class="monospaced">
setenv SCI_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS_DIR $HOME/on-the-fly-libs
</literallayout>
for csh-like shells.
</para> 

<para>It can also be changed by setting the value of this variable in
your <filename>.scirunrc</filename>
file. Your <filename>.scirunrc</filename> file would contain, for example:
<literallayout class="monospaced">
SCI_ON_THE_FLY_LIBS_DIR=/home/me/on-the-fly-libs
</literallayout>
Your <filename>.scirunrc</filename> file is read by &sr; at startup.
</para>

<para>Customizing the value of this variable for each &sr; user has
the following benefits:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>It allows multiple users to run the same instance of &sr; (at
the same time) without worrying about dynamic compilation conflicts.
For example, by specifying an <filename>on-the-fly-libs</filename>
directory in their home directory, a user can run the same shared
&sr; installed in <filename>/usr/local</filename> that another user
is already running.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>It allows a <filename>/usr/local</filename> installation of &sr;
to be secure by not requiring that
<filename>/usr/local/&hellip;/on-the-fly-libs</filename> be writable by
all.  This is considered a potential security risk.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>It allows greater debugging and multiple build support by
allowing the user to change dynamically compiled code locations
between instances of &sr;.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Starting &sr;</title>

<para> After a successful build, <replaceable>BUILD_DIR</replaceable>
will contain the <filename>scirun</filename> executable. To start &sr;
type <command>./scirun</command>.  &sr;'s network editor window should
appear and the &sr; shell should start.</para>

<para>If the window does not appear note any errors displayed in the
&sr; console and see <xref endterm="helptitle"
linkend="help"/>.</para>
