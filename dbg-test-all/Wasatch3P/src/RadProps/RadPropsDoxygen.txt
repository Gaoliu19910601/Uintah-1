    RadProps is a library to calculate radiative properties of gas mixtures and
    particle-laden systems.
    
    \subpage Installation - directions on installing RadProps
    
    \section Key Classes to pay attention to
      - Gas Properties:
       - GreyGas - calculates properties of grey gas mixtures
       - FSK - calculates spectral properties of gas mixtures for the FSK model
      - Particle Properties:
       - ParticleRadCoeffs
       - Free function soot_abs_coeff() for obtaining soot properties.
