   \page Installation

   The expression library is built using <a
   href="http://www.cmake.org/"> CMake </a>.  Be sure that you have a
   relatively recent version of CMake installed on your machine.

   \section exprlib_depends Required Libraries:
   The following libraries are required to build the Expression library:

   - <a href="https://software.crsim.utah.edu"> SpatialOps
     library</a>.  You should download and install this library.  It
     also requires <a href="http://www.cmake.org/"> CMake </a>.

   - <a href="http://www.boost.org"> Boost libraries</a>  Specifically, the boost::thread library is required.
   
   - <a href="http://www.cmake.org"> CMake build system</a> 


   \section install_steps Instructions:

   -# Install the \link exprlib_depends required libraries \endlink as
      listed above.
   -# Download the <a href="https://software.crsim.utah.edu">
      Expression library</a>.
   -# Select a build location for the Expression library, e.g. \code
      mkdir myBuildDir; cd myBuildDir \endcode
   -# Run CMake via one of three methods:
      -# Use cmake from the command line and specify necessary variables, e.g.
        \code cmake <path to exprlib> \
       -D SpatialOps_DIR=<path> \
       -D ThreadPool_DIR=<path> \
       -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path to install dir>
       \endcode
      -# Use ccmake to interactively select options. \code ccmake
         <path to exprlib> \endcode At this point you should be able
         to fill in the appropriate information and type
         <code>c</code> and then <code>g</code>
      -# Use the CMake GUI (if installed on your system).
   -# Once you have run CMake, you will have a makefile in your build
      directory.  Now type \code make \endcode and be patient while
      the expression library and its associated tests build.  Once the
      build is complete, you should run the tests, \code make test
      \endcode and then install the code, \code make install \endcode

   There are a few key variables that control the Expression build and
   installation process:

   - \c SpatialOps_DIR - this specifies the location where the SpatialOps
     configuration file was installed.  This is nominally in
     \c /usr/local/share

   - \c CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX - this is the location where the library
     will be installed.

   - \c EXPR_CONFIG_INSTALL - this is the location where the configure
     file for the expression library should be installed.  This is
     important for projects that use the expression library with CMake
     as a build system.  This defaults to \c CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share.

   - \c CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE - Specify \c Release or \c Debug.

   - \c BUILD_GUI [ON|OFF] builds the GUI utility for generating expressions (requires QT4)
   - \c ENABLE_OUTPUT [ON|OFF] enables output of fields to disk through the library
   - \c ENABLE_TESTS [ON|OFF] enables testing
   - \c ENABLE_UINTAH [ON|OFF] enables the Uintah interface.  Incompatible with \c ENABLE_OUTPUT and \c ENABLE_LBMS
   - \c ENABLE_LBMS [ON|OFF] enables the LBMS interface.  Incompatible with \c ENABLE_OUTPUT and \c ENABLE_UINTAH
