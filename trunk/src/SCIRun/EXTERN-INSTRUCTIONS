This distribution of SCIRun is received via the svn:externals property.
Since svn cannot external files (only directories) AND we needed to
be able to put Uintah Dataflow in SCIRun/Packages/Uintah, this was done
in two stages:

1) Retrieve each external directory, via the svn:externals property
on this directory.
2) Retrieve each external toplevel file, via the svn cp command.

Currently each file and directory use a specific revision number.  This
is to make sure we don't run into any "SCIRun is broken in the current
release" issues, but that we get stable snapshots.

To update each external directory, do (from Uintah/src):

svn propedit svn:externals SCIRun

and change -r<OLD_REVISION> to -r<NEW_REVISION> where <OLD_REVISION>
is what's there, and <NEW_REVISION> is what you want it to be.

To update each external file, do (from Uintah/src/SCIRun):

svn merge -N https://code.sci.utah.edu/svn/SCIRun/cibc/trunk/SCIRun/src@<OLD_REVISION> https://code.sci.utah.edu/svn/SCIRun/cibc/trunk/SCIRun/src@<NEW_REVISION> .

The current revision is 37506.  Update this when you update the SCIRun version.

Then commit the changes.
