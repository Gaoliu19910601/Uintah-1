    <p>
      Dataflow/Constraints contains a set of constraint classes.
      These classes can be used to maintain constrained relationships
      such that when one variable changes, the other inter-dependent
      variables can be updated accordingly.  For example, with the
      DistanceConstraint, two points are constrained to be a fixed
      distance apart.  If one point moves to a new location, the other
      point must be moved in order to maintain that constraint.  Some
      of the simpler constraints are solved using direct methods,
      while more complex constraints are solved using interative
      methods.

    <!-- Discuss why a developer would need or want to use the

      <p>
        The classes in this directory are useful when there is a
        constrained relationship between data values.  The specific
        constraints we have implemented are geometric in nature,
        arrising from our primary application of these classes: 3D
        widget controls.

    <!-- Discuss when or where to use the functions and classes in
         this directory: From within modules?, when a certain event
	 occurs? -->
      <p>
        To date, these constraints have only been used within the
        widget classes, but they are general enough that they can
        directly be used elsewhere.
