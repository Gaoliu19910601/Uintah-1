      <p>This module adds a clock to the view. It is most useful when
      rendering animations. It has a single input which is matrix
      containing one value, the time. The output is geometry. </p>
      <p>The clock type may be either a digital or analog. When
      creating an analog clock it is possible to also display the time
      digitally.</p> <p>The clock style sets the border and color. If
      the time is displayed digitally the format can be set using a C
      style format.</p> <p>The clock range sets beginning and end time
      for an analog clock.</p> <p>The clock size sets size.</p> <p>The
      clock location set the location to be in one of the viewer
      corners.</p>
