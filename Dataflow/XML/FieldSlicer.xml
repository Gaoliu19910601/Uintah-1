The Field Slicer module reduces the dimension of a topologically
regular field by 1 dimension.
      </p>

<p> The Field Slicer input port is a field that has regular topology.
The field will be reduced by 1 dimension and piped to the output
port. The user must supply two input values via the module GUI, the
axis the field is reduced along and location along the selected
axis. </p>
