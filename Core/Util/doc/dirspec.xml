    <p>
      Core/Util is a miscellaneous collection of code.  The code can be
      classified into 3 groups: debugging tools, timing routines, and
      SCIRun internal code.
    </p>
    <p>The debugging tools and timing routines are generally useful.  The
      SCIRun internal code is not.
    </p>
    <p>The SCIRun internal code consists of routines for accessing shared
      libraries and work arounds of bugs on Linux platforms.
    </p>
  </fit>
  <use>
    <when>
      <p>Use the the debugging and timing tools when developing any kind of code.</p>
    </when>
    <why>
      <p>
	Use the debugging tools to specify data invariants, catch
	programming errors, and log messages during program execution.
      </p>
      <p>
	The timer tools can be used to analyze code bottlenecks and perform
	other timing tasks.
