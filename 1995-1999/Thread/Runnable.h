DESCRIPTION
   
   This class should be a base class for any class which is to be
   attached to a thread.  It provides a <i>run</i> virtual method
   which can be overridden to provide the thread body.  When this
   method returns, or the thread calls <i>Thread::exit</i>, the
   thread terminates.  A <b>Runnable</b> should be attached to
   only one thread.
  
   <p> It is very important that the <b>Runnable</b> object (or any
   object derived from it) is never explicitly deleted.  It will be
   deleted by the <b>Thread</b> to which it is attached, when the
   thread terminates.  The destructor will be executed in the context
   of this same thread.
